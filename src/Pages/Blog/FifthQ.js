        A unit can be anything you want it to be â€” a line of code, a method, or a class. Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique using which individual modules are tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer himself.The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.
